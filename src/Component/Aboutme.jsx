            I started my career in customer service, where I learned how to
            understand people’s needs and solve problems quickly. Over time, I
            became excited to shift my career into the world of code, creating
            digital solutions that make life easier and more enjoyable.
            Outside of coding, I love traveling to new places and watching movies
            that inspire creativity. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled
            Full Stack Developer, building projects from idea to completion.
            I’m ready to bring your vision to life — and I’m waiting for our
            next great collaboration.
